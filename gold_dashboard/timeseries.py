"""Shared time series fetchers, reused by both the backtest
(gold_dashboard/backtest.py) and the main dashboard's per-indicator charts

takes an explicit `years` argument (default: YEARS below) — the backtest page
lets the user adjust this per its own independent session state, while the
main dashboard always passes its own fixed value, so the two never affect
each other.
